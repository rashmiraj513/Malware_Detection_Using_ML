# Malware Detection using Machine Learning README

- Malware poses a significant threat in today's digital landscape, encompassing a wide range of malicious activities such as data theft, espionage, and system damage.
- Traditional antivirus scanners struggle to keep pace with the growing diversity of malware, leading to millions of compromised hosts annually.
- The ease of access to malware development tools and anti-detection techniques has lowered the barrier for entry into cyberattacks, with script-kiddies and automated attacks becoming more prevalent.
- Machine learning offers a promising approach to malware detection by enabling software to learn and recognize patterns of malicious behavior, thereby enhancing the ability to detect new and evolving threats without relying solely on signature-based methods.
- Unlike signature-based approaches that can only detect known malware, machine learning which work as behavior-based approach, can identify suspicious patterns and behaviors even in previously unseen threats, making it a valuable tool in the fight against cyber threats.

## Objectives

- Develop a machine learning-based malware detection system to address the limitations of signature-based methods, enabling proactive identification of new and evolving threats.
- Enhance cybersecurity measures by leveraging advanced algorithms to detect malicious patterns and behaviors, providing robust protection against the growing diversity of malware attacks.

## How to run?

First, make sure that you are in the root directory `Malware_Detection_Using_ML` and install all the dependencies.

1. Now, to run, enter the following command in your terminal: `python main.py`. One menu driven program will start running if everything is okay.
2. Now, choose either 1 or, 2 according to your choice.
3. When it comes to enter the file path and file name then enter the file path, file name along with `.exe` extension.
   For example: `C:\Users\rashm\Downloads\Installables\VSCodeUserSetup-x64-1.83.1.exe`
4. To exit, enter other than `1` when it asks.
